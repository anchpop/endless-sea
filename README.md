## Development

Install rustup, make sure you're using the nightly toolchain with `rustup default nightly` and `rustup update`, then run `cargo run`!

On macOS or Linux, you'll get better compilation performance if you use:

```
cargo run --features bevy/dynamic
```


### Git-branchless

We recommend development with `git-branchless`. Find the [installation instructions here](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki/Installation).
