The vast and endless sea  
Is a place of mystery  
It's a place of beauty  
And it's a place of danger

There's something about the sea  
That's both intriguing and scary  
It's a place where you can get lost  
And where you can find yourself

The sea is a place of adventure  
And a place of calm  
It's a place where you can explore  
And a place where you can relax

The vast and endless sea  
Is a place that everyone should see  
It's a place that will take your breath away  
And a place that you'll never forget
